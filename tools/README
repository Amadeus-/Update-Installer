This directory contains a set of tools for preparing auto-updates.

 * create-packages.rb

	Given a directory containing the set of files that make up a release,
	laid out as they are when installed and a JSON file mapping files
	to packages, this tool generates a set of packages for the release
	and a file_list.xml listing all the files that make up the release.

 * single-package-map.json

    This is the simplest possible package map, where all files for
	a release are placed in a single package.  This means that the whole
	package will need to be downloaded to install the update.
